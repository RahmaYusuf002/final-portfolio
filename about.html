    Hello, am Rahma Yussuf an IT student in the class of 2023. I'm a hardworking, passionate
    person who believes in the importance of education and accessibility to technological advancements.
    <br>
    <br>
    My computer experience started early, my parents had already taught me how to use the internet
    by the time I was old enough to understand it. My dad was a teacher so he encouraged me to pursue 
    IT as my career path from a young age.
    <br>
    <br>
    I love learning how computers work, how they interact with the human world and what makes them tick.
    Am excited to learn more about this field and continue contributing to the world around me through technology.
    Now that I've gotten a taste of it, I can't stop. It's advantageous and I hope to learn more about the field as 
    my career progresses.
